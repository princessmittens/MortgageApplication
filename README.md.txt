Application execution starts with a user landing on the Mortgage signUp page where the user fills 
out the application for a mortgage. Remember the address you are putting in the application 
because that will be used as a key while approving the application.

Press of a submit button redirects the user to a mortgage login page for logging into the website 
and checking the status and seeing the mortgage application number(Needed in the consent form)

User then goes on to employee login page and logs into it to land on consent form where user puts
in the mortgage application number and address(has to be the same as in mortgage signup application form)
and based on if you click the consent checkbox user will be redirected to either consent success form or consent_error form.

If consent is given then the user logs back into the mortgage website and see the updated status and completes the task of the assignment.
